        <h1>Pakistan's Agency</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Introduction to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC):</h2>
        <p>The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) is the leading government body responsible for the development of nuclear technology in Pakistan. Established in 1956, its mission is to harness atomic energy for peaceful purposes, including electricity generation, healthcare, agriculture, and scientific research. Over the decades, PAEC has played a vital role in strengthening Pakistan’s technological and scientific capabilities, and it continues to contribute significantly to national progress and energy security.</p>
        <h2>About:</h2>
        <p>The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) is the premier government agency responsible for developing and promoting nuclear science and technology in Pakistan. It was established in 1956 with the vision to use atomic energy for peaceful purposes, including energy generation, medical treatment, agriculture, and scientific research.</p>
      
<p>
<ul><li><b> Nuclear Power Generation:</li></b>
PAEC operates several nuclear power plants, such as Chashma and Karachi Nuclear Power Plants, which contribute to Pakistan's electricity grid.

<li><b>Scientific Research:</li></b>
The commission runs world-class research centers like PINSTECH (Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology), promoting innovation in physics, chemistry, and materials science.

<li><b>Medical Services:</li></b>
PAEC manages over 18 cancer hospitals across Pakistan, offering affordable treatment through nuclear medicine and radiation therapy.

<li><b>Agriculture & Industry:</li></b>
It helps improve crop production through nuclear techniques and supports industries with quality control and isotope technology.

<li><b>National Defense (Controversial Aspect):</li></b>
Although PAEC was initially civilian-focused, it played a crucial role in Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program, especially during the 1970s–1990s. The commission was central to the successful nuclear tests in May 1998, which made Pakistan a declared nuclear power.

<li><b>Key Achievements:</li></b>
Successfully launched Pakistan’s nuclear energy program.

Built Pakistan’s first research reactor in 1965.

Developed nuclear fuel cycle technologies.

Contributed to Pakistan’s self-reliance in nuclear science.

<li><b>Headquarters:</li></b>
PAEC is headquartered in Islamabad, the capital of Pakistan.</p>

<h2>Main Works of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC):</h2>
<p>The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) works in several important areas to support the country’s development, especially in science, energy, and health. Here are its key responsibilities:</p>

<p> <b>1. Nuclear Power Generation:</b><br>
PAEC builds and operates nuclear power plants to help solve Pakistan’s electricity shortage. Major plants include:

Nuclear Power Plants (C-1 to C-4)

Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP)

These plants provide a clean and reliable source of energy.
 <p> <b>2. Scientific Research:</b><br>
PAEC promotes research in nuclear science, physics, chemistry, and engineering. It runs advanced labs like:

PINSTECH (Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology)

This research supports both civilian and strategic programs.

 <p> <b>3. Healthcare and Cancer Treatment:</b><br>
PAEC operates over 18 nuclear medical centers across Pakistan. These hospitals use nuclear technology for:

Cancer diagnosis and treatment

Nuclear medicine

Radiotherapy

It provides low-cost treatment to thousands of patients every year.

 <p> <b>4. Agriculture and Food:</b><br>
PAEC uses nuclear techniques to:

Improve crop production

Control pests

Develop disease-resistant plants

This helps farmers grow more food and improve Pakistan’s food security.

 <p> <b>5. Industrial Support:</b><br>
PAEC helps industries by offering:

Radiation-based testing

Isotope technology

Quality control services

This improves product safety and boosts industrial productivity.

 <p> <b>6. National Defense (Strategic Role):</b><br>
PAEC played a key role in developing Pakistan’s nuclear weapons program, especially during the 1970s–1990s. It was directly involved in:

Nuclear fuel cycle development

Design and testing of nuclear devices (like the 1998 nuclear tests)</p>
