        <h1>Iran's Agency:</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) – Introduction</h2>
        <p>The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) is the governmental authority responsible for the development and regulation of nuclear technology in Iran. Founded in 1974, it operates under the supervision of the President of Iran and plays a central role in implementing Iran's nuclear policy, both for peaceful energy generation and scientific research.

Headquartered in Tehran, the AEOI manages uranium enrichment, nuclear fuel production, nuclear power plant operations, and research reactors. It also serves as Iran’s main liaison with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), especially regarding inspections, safeguard agreements, and compliance with international nuclear treaties.

The AEOI oversees several key nuclear facilities, including the Natanz and Fordow enrichment sites, the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant, and the Arak Heavy Water Reactor. Over the years, it has been at the center of global attention due to concerns over the potential military dimensions of Iran’s nuclear program.

Despite international controversies, the AEOI maintains that its activities are strictly peaceful and in line with international law, emphasizing nuclear energy’s role in medicine, agriculture, and electricity generation.</p>

<h2>Features of Atomic energy organization of Iran:</h2>
<p><b> 1. Government Authority on Nuclear Energy:</b><br>

Medical applications

Agricultural research

Scientific innovation 
</p>

 <p><b>3. Facility Oversight:</b> <br>
The AEOI manages and supervises all major nuclear facilities, including:

Natanz and Fordow (uranium enrichment)

Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant

Arak Heavy Water Reactor

Research and development centers
</p>

<p><b> 4. Nuclear Fuel Cycle Management:</b> <br>
Involved in the entire nuclear fuel cycle:

Conversion and enrichment

Fuel fabrication

Waste management
</p>

 <p><b>5. Research and Scientific Development:</b> <br>
Operates multiple research institutes, such as.

Nuclear Science and Technology Research Institute (NSTRI)

Promotes nuclear technology in medicine (e.g., radiopharmaceuticals) and agriculture.

 <p><b>6. International Relations and IAEA Coordination:</b> <br>
Acts as Iran’s main point of contact with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
